        category – the Newton originated the term "personal digital assistant" – it was once the first to feature handwriting recognition. Apple
        commenced developing the platform in 1987 and shipped the first units in 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton
        devices run on a proprietary running system, Newton OS; examples include Apple's MessagePad sequence and the eMate 300, and other organizations
         additionally launched gadgets jogging on Newton OS. Most Newton gadgets had been based totally on the ARM 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting-based
