    <h2>1933- Telex Messaging network comes on line</h2>
    <p>Like the Volkswagen Beetle and modern freeway systems, the Telex messaging network comes out of the early period of Germany’s Third Reich. Telex starts to distribute military messages,
      but soon becomes a world-wide network of both official and commercial text messaging that will persist in some countries into the 2000s.
      Telex uses teleprinters, which date back to the 1910s for use in telegraphy. But instead of using pricey dedicated telegraph lines,
      the telex system connects those teleprinters to each other over voice telephone lines, routed by modified telephone switches.
      Wireless versions of Telex soon connect remote regions of the developing world.Telex provided the first common medium for international
      record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as specified by the International Telecommunication Union.</p>

    <h2>1993- Apple Ships the first Newton</h2>
    <p>Apple enters the handheld computer market with the Newton. Dubbed a “Personal Data Assistant” by Apple President John Scully in 1992,
      the Newton featured many of the features that would define handheld computers in the following decades. The handwriting recognition software was
      much maligned for inaccuracy. The Newton line never performed as well as hoped and was discontinued in 1998.</p>

    <h2>2003-PowerMac G5</h2>
    <p> With a distinctive anodized aluminum case, and hailed as the first true 64-bit personal computer, the Apple G5 is the most powerful Macintosh ever
      released to that point. While larger than the previous G4 towers, the G5 had comparatively limited space for expansion. Virginia Tech used more than a
      thousand PowerMac G5s to create the System X cluster supercomputer, rated #3 in November of that year on the world’s TOP500 fastest computers.</p>

    <h2>2011-Nest Learning Thermostat</h2>
    <p>The Nest Learning Thermostat is an early product made for the emerging “Internet of Things,” which envisages a world in which common everyday devices
      have network connectivity and can exchange information or be controlled. The Nest allowed for remote access to a user’s home’s thermostat by using a
      smartphone or tablet and could also send monthly power consumption reports to help save on energy bills. The Nest would remember what temperature users
      preferred by ‘training’ itself to monitor daily use patterns for a few days then adopting that pattern as its new way of controlling home temperature.</p>

    <h2>2015-Apple Watch</h2>
    <p>Building a computer into the watch form factor has been attempted many times but the release of the Apple Watch leads to a new level of excitement.
      Incorporating a version of Apple's iOS operating system, as well as sensors for environmental and health monitoring, the Apple Watch was designed to be
      incorporated into the Apple environment with compatibility with iPhones and Mac Books. Almost a million units were ordered on the day of release.
      The Watch was received with great enthusiasm, but critics took issue with the somewhat limited battery life and high price.</p>
